  "description": "This is a simple visual traceroute app written in javascript that runs in the browser. The traceroute part written using nodejs runs as a local web server that uses a web socket to stream locational info related to each hop reached during the traceroute. To obtain locational info about each hop the ip-api.com web service is queried using the hops IP address. This hop info is then sent to the browser where it is displayed on a table as well as drawn on a map.",
